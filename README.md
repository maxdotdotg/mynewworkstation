================

Script to set up software I like to use on a new Ubuntu workstation (updates current installation and then installs vlc, git, clamscan, zsh, skype, python, ruby, pip, openssl, curl, chromium-browser, p7zip, ubuntu-tweak).

Once the above software has been installed, zsh is configured (I'm using Eddy's zsh config: https://github.com/luchasei/zsh-config).
